In the search field type "WooCommerce One Click Upsell Funnel" and click Search Plugins.

Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
